---
== Overview

Pigeons is a desktop level application created for delivery companies to better assign and
organize deliveries for the delivery people.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to log in to a customised profile and address book instance*
** What it does: allows the user to log in to a customised profile, with each user profile linked to its own customised address book instance and user preferences
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides the option for users to use different profiles (many users can continue to share one profile if preferred). It is more conceivable that different users would have different addressees to send deliveries to and hence having a customised list of addressees would help each user have a better overview of their addressees and perform their deliveries more effectively.
** Highlights: This enhancement introduces a whole new component that initiates even before the start of the main application, denying access to existing addressee lists to users who do not possess valid login details.
** Credits: -

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhanced user interface for application overall by adding useful labels in the main application and instructions to the login screen.
